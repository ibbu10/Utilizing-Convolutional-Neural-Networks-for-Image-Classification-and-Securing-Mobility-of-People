# Abstract of our Paper
Image recognition is widely used for detecting human obstructions and identifying people
with disabilities. The accuracy of identifying images of handicapped people is powered by the image
classification techniques that based on deep learning methodologies. Specifically, Convolutional Neural
Networks is employed to improve image classification of people with mental and physical disabilities. In
this research, images of people with different disabilities are used to extract hidden features that symbolize
each disability. Three different deep learning image classifiers are built to classify images of people on
wheelchairs, blind people, and people with Down syndrome. A security technique is developed that is based
on Multi-Protocol Label Switching headers to secure the image mobility over cloud nodes. The proposed
approach is validated by measuring the impact of the deep learning image classifiers on image classification
and securing image mobility on cloud system performance. The experimental results show the effectiveness
of the proposed approach in improving disabled peopleâ€™s image prediction and enhancing the performance
of securing image mobility in cloud systems.
